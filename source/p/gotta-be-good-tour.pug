          The GiveGetWin event has, literally, the highest return on my time
          invested of anything I've ever done in my adult life. What an amazing
          experience.

        **Update - 29 Apr 2016:** Added my talk and photos from the 2015 tour below.

        Despite all the technology that exists to connect us, there is
        something about face-to-face conversations that remains unmatched.
        GiveGetWin's annual [Gotta Be Good Tour](http://tour.givegetwin.com) is
        built around this idea, and I'm honored to have been a guest speaker in
        2014.

        On the surface, the tour was simply a way for the nonprofit to recruit
        engaged volunteers across North American university campuses. Stepping
        into those auditoriums, however, revealed a rare gathering of students,
        professionals, entrepreneurs, academics, and community members. Despite
        many diverse ages and backgrounds, everyone I met shared a love for
        learning, personal growth, and making an impact.

        We spoke in front of over a dozen audiences over six weeks, and I had
        some of the most interesting conversations of my life as a result of
        it. I was also greatly impressed by the magnitude of what the volunteer
        team was able to accomplish with zero budget, in a short amount of
        time.

        A big thank-you to GiveGetWin for the invitation to tell my story. If
        you're a student, professor, or just generally interested in
        effectiveness and making a difference, I recommend you give them a
        call.
